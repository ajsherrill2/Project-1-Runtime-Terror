# The Book Club

## Description

We wanted to create a mobile friendly application that had the ability to easily look up information on books, where they can be bought, and additional information on the book that is relevant to a book reader. We aimed to design something simple that would help readers expand their book shelves, book stores like Google, Amazon, and Thriftbooks fill their design with self-promotion, ads, and other industry identifying information that is irrelevant to the consumer.

This project consolidates this by running the data through a series of filters to limit what the consumer needs to browse, as well as provide recommendations for where readers can start. We learned about manipulating data from fetch requests to help with filtering the 78 data fields that Google provides you when you use their book store and making the data user friendly. We also learned extensively how to use third party styling, and about the benefits and drawbacks of locking a project into using a specific set. By locking our project into Materialize we limit our overall creative input on how the application looks.
